# EasyPoll

EasyPoll is the first of Free Code Camp's full-stack challenges and uses Node as its backbone. These are the "user stories" this app must fulfill:

* As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
* As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
* As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
* As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
* As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
* As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
* As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form.
* As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

The app is built with Express framework and MongoDB as its database. Passport provides user verification and authentication.
